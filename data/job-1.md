Considering the agile structure of the development team, I worked as a front-end developer to achieve these:

- Design & implement Angular application infrastructure including library modules, generic services, TypeScript libraries, etc.
- Design & implement a full swagger-codegen to use along with our microservices.
- Design & implement a stand-alone module for the application's dashboard.
  - Dynamic dashboard creation like MS Power BI, with dynamic data source load.
- Transform old ASP.NET MVC Razor pages into new AngularTS application.
- Maintain old codes written in ASP.NET MVC and JQuery + Boostrap.
